- ### `What is HTML?`


  - `HyperText Markup Language`, or HTML. It is a markup language that is utilized to design and generate web pages. To describe the text, pictures, links, and multimedia on a webpage, it employs a set of tags and attributes.

  - HTML pages are made up of several elements that are contained in tags. Tags are used to specify how the material is formatted and organized. The tag, for instance, is used to insert an image as well as specify headings, paragraphs, and paragraphs.


  - Additionally, HTML enables you to link between other web sites and incorporate multimedia elements like audio and video into your webpages.

  - Anyone interested in developing websites or online apps must have a solid understanding of HTML, which is the foundation of web development. It is simple to use and has a sizable developer community that contributes to its continuous growth and improvement.

### `Tags That are used in Html:`
HTML uses tags to define the structure and formatting of content within a webpage. Here are some of the most commonly used HTML tags:

1. `<html>` - Defines the beginning and end of an HTML
              document
2. `<head>` - Defines the head section of an HTML document, 
         which contains metadata such as the title of the webpage
3.  `<body>` - Defines the body section of an HTML document, 
         which contains the visible content of the webpage
4.  `<p>` -    Defines a paragraph
5.  `<h1> to <h6>` - Defines headings of different sizes and
                     levels
6.  `<a>` -    Defines a hyperlink
7. `<img>` -   Inserts an image
8. `<ul>` -    Defines an unordered list
9. `<ol>` -   Defines an ordered list
10. `<li>` - Defines a list item
11. `<table>` - Defines a table
12. `<tr>` - Defines a table row
13. `<td>` - Defines a table cell
14. `<form>` - Defines a form for user input
15. `<input>` - Defines an input field within a form
16. `<select>` - Defines a dropdown list within a form
17. `<button>` - Defines a clickable button
18. `<div>` - Defines a section or division within a webpage
19. `<span>` - Defines a small section of text
20. `<br>` - Inserts a line break


There are many more HTML tags available, but these are some of the most commonly used ones.

- ### `Creators of HTML:`


   - HTML was developed by `Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in the early 1990s`. The initial version of HTML, HTML 1.0, was released in 1993, and it was followed by several other versions, each introducing new features and improvements.

   - `Berners-Lee developed HTML as a means of sharing scientific information among researchers across different computer systems`. He wanted to create a way for scientists to easily exchange documents and data over the internet, regardless of the platform or software they were using.

- ### `History of HTML:`

  - At the CERN (European Organisation for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland, `Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues originally invented HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, in the early 1990s`. The World Wide Web was a project that Berners-Lee was working on that sought to establish a worldwide network of connected information and resources that could be accessed online.

  - `1993 saw the introduction of HTML 1.0, the first version of HTML`. Users could build simple web pages with text, links, and images using this straightforward language's constrained set of tags and properties. With the addition of new tags and features to allow more sophisticated web design and functionality.
  -  HTML experienced a number of changes and upgrades during the following several years.

  - Tables, form elements, and image maps were among the new capabilities added to HTML `2.0 in 1995`. In `1997, HTML 3.2 was released`, adding even more sophisticated capabilities including frames and style sheets.

  - A significant upgrade to HTML, `HTML 4.0 was launched in 1997` and included new tags and properties for `multimedia, scripting, and sophisticated layout and formatting`. Additionally, it supported cascading style sheets (CSS), enabling more adaptable and effective web design.

  -  HTML is a vital tool for online designers and developers today, and it is always developing with new iterations and upgrades to meet the web's shifting requirement.
 
 
 
 # world with html:
  -  HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a crucial part of the modern web experience, allowing for the creation and presentation of rich and interactive web content. 
  -  It provides a structured markup language that allows content creators to define 
    1. the organization and hierarchy of elements on a web page, 
    2. enabling consistent layouts,
    3.  headings, 
    4. paragraphs,
    5.  lists, 
    6. tables, 
    7. other elements.

  -   It also introduces hyperlinks, which enable the seamless linking of different 
      1. web pages,
      2.  websites, or resources.
      
  -   Multimedia integration: HTML supports embedding various media types, including
        1.  images, 
        2.  videos,
        3.  audio files,
        4.  interactive elements.
        
  -  Web forms and user input: HTML provides form elements such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, and submit buttons, enabling the creation of interactive
      forms that facilitate user input, data collection, and interactive features.

HTML is the backbone of the `World Wide Web, empowering content creators and web developers to structure, link, and present information effectively`.
- CSS integration allows web developers to `apply styles, layouts, colors, fonts, and other visual properties to HTML elements, providing enhanced control over the presentation and aesthetics of web content`. 
- Accessibility support: HTML includes semantic elements and attributes that contribute to web accessibility. Search engine optimization (SEO): HTML provides meta tags, header tags, and other attributes that allow content creators to optimize their web pages for search engines. 
- Web standards and compatibility: HTML is a standardized language maintained by the W3C, ensuring cross-browser compatibility and adherence to web development best practices. Overall, HTML is the backbone of the World Wide Web, empowering content creators and web developers to structure, link, and present information effectively.
     
 ## world without HTML:
 
 - HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and structuring the content on the internet.
 -  It provides a way to define the structure, layout, and elements of a web page, allowing browsers to interpret and render the content.
 -  Without HTML, web pages would lack a consistent 
 1. structure, 
 2. no hypertext linking, 
 3. no rich media embedding,
 4.  no web-based applications, 
 5. no accessibility support, 
 6. no search engine indexing, 
 7.  no standardized web standards. 
 - Without HTML, the web would lack structure, inter connectivity, and many of the features that we rely on for browsing and accessing information online.

 # _Now let's try to write a code by using the html tags in the HTML Programming_:

        <html>
             <head>
              <title>
                  This is my first webpage!!!!
              </title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>----Hi to Every one----</h1> 
                <p>.....This is my first web page about  
                         about the HTML.....</p>
           </body>
        </html>


- Note: To get the output we need to Install the Live server in the source editior

- The output for the above html code will be like

            </div>
            </body>
              </html>


 - This is one of the example of html

  <img width="611" alt="Capture" src="https://github.com/GaneshPelluru/HTML-by-Ganesh/assets/128490912/d72b8e6f-823e-4e8c-b998-ccf5803acb1d">
  
## explaination :-
  The code starts with the declaration of the HTML document using the `<!DOCTYPE html>` tag.

   1. The `<html>` tag encloses the entire HTML content.

   2. The `<head>` section contains meta-information and links to external resources. In this case, it includes a `<title>` tag that sets the title of the web page as "Family Tree Diagram" and a `<style>` tag for defining the CSS styles used in the document.

   3. Inside the `<style>` tag, there are various CSS rules that define the appearance and layout of the family tree diagram. These rules target specific elements using class and tag      selectors.

   4. The main content of the family tree diagram is contained within a `<div>` element with the class "tree".

   5. The `<h1>` tag is used to display the heading "My Family Tree" at the center of the diagram.

   6. The actual tree structure is represented using nested `<ul>` (unordered list) and `<li> (list item)` elements. Each `<li>` element represents a person in the family tree.

   7. The `<a>` (anchor) tags within the `<li>` elements are used to display the names of family members and provide clickable links. In this example, "Balamurali (Father)", "Ganesh
       (Child 1)", and "Lavanya (Child 2)" are the names displayed.

   8. The indentation of the nested `<ul>` elements creates a hierarchical structure, where children are nested within their parents.

   9. CSS styles such as padding, position, border, and background color are applied to the elements to create the tree-like appearance.

   10. The CSS pseudo-elements (::before and ::after) are used to draw the connecting lines between the nodes of the family tree.

   11. The CSS styles define the font, font size, text alignment, and other visual properties of the text and tree elements.

  10. The closing `</body>` and `</html>` tags signify the end of the HTML document.

Overall, the code uses HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing family tree diagram with clickable links to represent the relationships between family members.
