- ### `What is HTML?`


  - `HyperText Markup Language`, or HTML. It is a markup language that is utilized to design and generate web pages. To describe the text, pictures, links, and multimedia on a webpage, it employs a set of tags and attributes.

  - Additionally, HTML enables you to link between other web sites and incorporate multimedia elements like audio and video into your webpages.

  - Anyone interested in developing websites or online apps must have a solid understanding of HTML, which is the foundation of web development. It is simple to use and has a sizable developer community that contributes to its continuous growth and improvement.

### `Tags That are used in Html:`
HTML uses tags to define the structure and formatting of content within a webpage. Here are some of the most commonly used HTML tags:

1. `<html>` - Defines the beginning and end of an HTML
              document

- ### `Creators of HTML:`


   - HTML was developed by `Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in the early 1990s`. The initial version of HTML, HTML 1.0, was released in 1993, and it was followed by several other versions, each introducing new features and improvements.

   - `Berners-Lee developed HTML as a means of sharing scientific information among researchers across different computer systems`. He wanted to create a way for scientists to easily exchange documents and data over the internet, regardless of the platform or software they were using.

- ### `History of HTML:`

  - At the CERN (European Organisation for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland, `Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues originally invented HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, in the early 1990s`. The World Wide Web was a project that Berners-Lee was working on that sought to establish a worldwide network of connected information and resources that could be accessed online.

  - `1993 saw the introduction of HTML 1.0, the first version of HTML`. Users could build simple web pages with text, links, and images using this straightforward language's constrained set of tags and properties. With the addition of new tags and features to allow more sophisticated web design and functionality.
  -  HTML experienced a number of changes and upgrades during the following several years.

  - Tables, form elements, and image maps were among the new capabilities added to HTML `2.0 in 1995`. In `1997, HTML 3.2 was released`, adding even more sophisticated capabilities including frames and style sheets.

  - A significant upgrade to HTML, `HTML 4.0 was launched in 1997` and included new tags and properties for `multimedia, scripting, and sophisticated layout and formatting`. Additionally, it supported cascading style sheets (CSS), enabling more adaptable and effective web design.

  -  HTML is a vital tool for online designers and developers today, and it is always developing with new iterations and upgrades to meet the web's shifting requirement.

 # _Now let's try to write a code by using the html tags in the HTML Programming_:

        <html>
             <head>
              <title>
                  This is my first webpage!!!!
              </title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>----Hi to Every one----</h1> 
                <p>.....This is my first web page about  
                         about the HTML.....</p>
           </body>
        </html>


- Note: To get the output we need to `_Install the Live server_` in the source platform

  - The output will be like:
